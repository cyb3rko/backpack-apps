## About this project
BackPack is an Android app collection.  
The goal is to deliver handy but also modern and secure apps for different tasks.

And what's important: All Open Source.

| | More may be coming in the future... |

## Q & A

- Will the different get merged into one main app?
  - No, I want to keep the apps single purpose.
